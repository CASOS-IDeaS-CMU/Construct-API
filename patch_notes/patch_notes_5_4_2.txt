Allowed for the event count printed by Social_Media::cleanup to be disabled by setting Construct::verbose_runtime to false.
Fixed a bug that was causing emotions to be driven to zero when reading emotions in Emotions::communicate.
Fixed a bug where the "interval time duration" could not go below 1.0 in Social_Media_no_followers.
Each model has had their name removed from the Model class. Model names are stored instead within the model manager.
With name removal Model does not need to be inherieted virtually. Many models now no longer virtually inheriets.
Default members of the Model class have been changed to references rather than pointers.
Nodeset and Node now have bracket operators simplifying accessing nodes and node attributes. 
Some functions in Nodeset and Node have been renamed to make it more clear what the functions do.
Social_Media_no_followers::media_user now holds a Social_Media_no_followers pointer. Each class that derives from media_user has a function that casts Social_Media_no_followers pointer to the appropriate derived class.
Social_Media_with_followers::users has been removed. Each class deriving from Social_Media_no_followers now casts Social_Media_no_followers::media_user to the appropriate derived class which should be an abstract class that inheriets from Social_Media_no_followers::media_user.
Modified load_model and load_output to take a Construct reference rather than a pointer.
Output and Output derived classes now use Construct references instead of pointers.
