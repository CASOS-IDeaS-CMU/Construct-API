When the source header files were combined into Construct_Library.h, some members of classes were not included. All classes should now have all members stored in memory displayed for the user.
Added methods for importing and exporting nodesets and networks in the NodesetManager and GraphManager, respectively. These allow nodesets and networks to persist between Construct runs.
Added a method to allow Construct to import an input xml file and parse it as if it were being done so in the API exes.
Added a method to nodesets that allow them to import from a DyNetML file as if it were being done through a nodeset generator in the input xml file.
The Constructor for Construct no longer requires a seed. Instead, the random seed can be set through the new function Random::set_seed.
The manager classes have been changed to member variables rather than pointers allocated on the heap. This simplifies data management for Construct.
Nodes and nodesets can now be created outside of the NodesetManager, however to ensure indexes are handled properly, nodes created outside a nodeset can not be added to a nodeset.
Dropped the & from the communicate function of models as iterator copies are inexpensive.
The current_time and time_count members are now public in Construct. Time count is still set by the time nodeset during loading in the API exe or when Construct::run is called.
Removed various restriction on dereferencing certain classes.
