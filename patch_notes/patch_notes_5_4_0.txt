Added support to export social media events to json file.
Added version strings to Construct, this will check when creating a custom library if the exe and library have the same version string.
Removed CONSTRUCT_LIB as it was no longer needed for any classes or functions.
Changed InteractionItem::item_keys to be forward declared when using the preprocessor definition CUSTOM_ITEM_KEYS. The file "item_keys.h" is then included after. The file makes it explicit that the enumuration can be edited.
Filters have been modified for visual studio to add clarity on which files can be edited and which files should not.
Various social media models are added to the create model function.
The Trust models has included trust between agents.
An additional parameter has been added to construct which defines a file path to the custom library.
