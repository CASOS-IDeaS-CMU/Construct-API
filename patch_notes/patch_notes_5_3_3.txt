Modified the library loading process such that the dll/shared library is no longer required to run the executable. Construct will search for the library in the local directory. If the library is found and verbose initialization is enabled, a message will be displayed. Similarily, a message will also be displayed if the associated function pointers are also found.
When creating an instance of Construct outside of the dll/shared library using the Construct static library, it will no longer be required to install the dll/shared library due to the previous change.
A typo caused default values for bounding boxes to not all be included in the parameters input for network generators.
Constructors for default reposting and quoting in Social Media models were accidentally swapped.
Checks on media_event deconstruction were accidently throwing assertions. This was not affecting release builds.
Some functions were reimplemented as const to improve performance.
The API functions have been moved into their own dedicated folder and a new folder has been created along side it. The Custom_Construct folder holds examples for how to manually create, initialize, and run a Construct simulation through c++ rather than an input xml file.
To better organize files, the construct static libraries have been moved to the include folder. In addition the Construct_Library.h function has been moved to the include folder and been renamed to simply Construct.h. Executables for the API still remain in the API_Functions folder.
