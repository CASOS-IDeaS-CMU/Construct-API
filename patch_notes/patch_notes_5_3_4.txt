Setting a link in the input xml file was not properly registering node indexes and was instead using the value in the xml document as the node name.
A bug caused column iterators to not terminate at the end of a column when the dimension representations were both dense.
Moved media_event and media_user into the Social_Media class.
Created a new container for Social_Media::list_of_events. The container inheriets from std::list, but some methods have been made private. This will prevent users from adding events to the list except at the beginning of the list. In addition, events are now checked when added that their time stamp is greater than or equal the most recent event added to ensure that the most recent events are at the front of the list.
Social_Media::list_of_events is now checked at the end of the think function and at the beginning of the clean_up function. An assertion is raised if the events are not descending in their time_stamp value.
Three functions are now visible in the Construct Header for the Social_Media class. These allow for user to examine memory when an assertion is raised related to an improper media_event creation. These functions are Social_Media::event_container::emplace_front, Social_Media::event_container::push_front, and Social_Media::check_list_order.
Seperated media_user into two classes, a base class used in Social_Media and default_media_user that inheriets from media_user to supply for default actions in the various functions. This will allow users to create new Social_Media based models and specialized users to go with those models.
