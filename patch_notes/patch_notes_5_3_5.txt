The default value for the communication access network created in the Location model was false instead of true.
Getting pointers from the GraphManager is more streamlined.
Graph pointers and references can now be initialized in header files.
Social_Media has been broken up into Social_Media_no_followers and Social_Media_with_followers. This allows for a social media operating without a follower network. An additional API function has been added to load users for these models.
Typeless_Graph now has a purely virtual function get_data_state which is implemented by Graph. This function allows for output of the state of the Graph without converting the Typeless_Graph pointer to the Typed version. This can also be used by developers to examine the state of the Graph in the middle of the simulation.
dynet::edge_types and associated functions have been moved into Typeless_Graph.
dynet::item_keys and associated functions have been moved into InteractionItem.
Output_Graph has been simplified using Typeless_Graph::get_data_state.
